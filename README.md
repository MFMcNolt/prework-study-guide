# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Doing this project allowed me to begin to understand what Bootcamp will be like before class commences.
I was motivated to do this project to ensure I was set up for success when Bootcamp commences.
I learnt ALOT. Starting with how many apps are needed to build this project including Terminal, GitHub and VSCode. Then connecting them and how each function works together even before begining to create the actual website itself. 
The project allowed me to understand and get familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.
